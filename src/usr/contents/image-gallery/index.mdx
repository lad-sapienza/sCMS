# Build responsive image galleries with lightbox functionality


The `MyGallery` component displays images from a specified folder in a responsive grid layout with lightbox functionality powered by PhotoSwipe. Images are automatically optimized using Gatsby's image processing capabilities for fast loading and great performance.

The component automatically looks for images in a `gallery/` subfolder based on the current page path. For example, if your page is at `/my-project/`, the gallery will display images from `/my-project/gallery/`. You can also specify a custom path using the `path` prop.

## Default usage (path based on current location)

When used without parameters, `MyGallery` automatically displays images from the `gallery/` subfolder of the current page path.

<Documenter>
  <MyGallery />
</Documenter>

## Custom path example

You can override the default path behavior by providing a specific path to the gallery folder:

<Documenter>
  <MyGallery path="image-gallery/gallery/" />
</Documenter>

## Image organization

To use the gallery component:

1. Create a folder structure in your content directory (typically `src/usr/contents/`)
2. Add a `gallery/` subfolder within your content folder
3. Place your images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`) in the `gallery/` folder

Example structure:
```
src/usr/contents/
├── my-project/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── gallery/
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       ├── image2.png
│       └── image3.jpg
```

The gallery will automatically:
- Generate responsive thumbnails (270x270px)
- Create optimized full-size versions
- Display images in a grid layout
- Enable lightbox functionality with zoom and navigation
- Show image names as captions in the lightbox

## API documentation

##### path
Optional path to the gallery folder. When provided, the component will look for images in the specified path instead of using the current page location.

If not provided, the component automatically uses the current page path (e.g., for a page at `/my-project/`, it looks for images in `/my-project/gallery/`).

- Type: `String`
- Required: No
- Default: Current page path + `/gallery/`
- Example: `"my-content/subfolder"` will look for images in `my-content/subfolder/gallery/`

---

##### reverseSorting
Reverse the default sorting order of images. By default, images are sorted in descending order by filename (DESC). When set to `true`, images will be displayed in ascending order (ASC).

- Type: `Boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`
- Example: `<MyGallery reverseSorting={true} />`

---

##### title
Optional title displayed above the gallery.
