# Getting Started with s:CMS

Welcome to **s:CMS**, a modern static content management system built on Astro! This framework provides a perfect balance between powerful features and simplicity, making it easy to create fast, SEO-friendly websites.

## What is s:CMS?

s:CMS is built with a **strict separation between core system and user code**:

- **`core/`**: Framework components, layouts, and utilities (updateable via git pull)
- **`usr/`**: Your content, custom components, and configurations (edit freely)

This architecture allows you to update core functionality without losing your customizations!

## Key Features

### 🎨 Rich Component Library

s:CMS comes with powerful pre-built components:

- **Gallery**: PhotoSwipe-powered image galleries with lightbox
- **Maps**: Interactive maps with Leaflet and vector layers
- **DataTb**: Dynamic tables with filtering and pagination
- **Search**: Full-text search across your content

### 📝 Content Collections

Use Astro's content collections for type-safe content management:

```typescript
// usr/content/config.ts
const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }),
});
```

### 🔄 Multiple Data Sources

Load content from various sources:

- Local MDX/Markdown files
- CSV and JSON files
- Directus CMS integration
- External APIs

### ⚡ Optimized Performance

Built on Astro's island architecture:

- Static-first with selective hydration
- Optimized images and assets
- Lightning-fast page loads
- Excellent Core Web Vitals scores

   ```

3. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Create your first page**
   
   Add a new file to `usr/pages/my-page.mdx`:

   title: 'My First Page'
   layout: ../../layouts/MdxLayout.astro
   ---
   
   # Hello s:CMS!
   
   This is my first page.
   ```

## Using Core Components

Import and use core components in your MDX files:

```mdx
import { GalleryMdx } from '@core/components/Gallery';

export const images = import.meta.glob('./gallery/*.jpg', { eager: true });

<GalleryMdx images={images} columns={{ min: 200, max: 3 }} client:idle />
```
