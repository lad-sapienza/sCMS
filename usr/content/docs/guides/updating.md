order: 4
---

This guide explains how to update your s:CMS installation to the latest version while preserving your customizations.

## TL;DR - Quick Update

```bash
npm run update-core
```

This automated script will:
1. Create a backup branch
2. Fetch latest changes from upstream
3. Merge updates while protecting your `usr/` folder
4. Install new dependencies if needed

## First Time Setup

If you haven't set up the update system yet:

```bash
npm run setup-upstream
```

This configures the connection to the s:CMS repository for receiving updates.

## What Gets Updated vs. What Stays Yours

### ✅ Always Updated (Framework Code)
- `core/**` - All framework components, layouts, and utilities
- Core package dependencies

### 🛡️ Always Protected (Your Content)
- `usr/**` - All your content, components, and customizations
- `usr/user.config.mjs` - Your site configuration
- `usr/scripts/local-packages.yml` - Your site-specific npm packages (see below)

### ⚠️ May Need Review (Shared Files)
- `package.json` - Dependencies may need merging
- `astro.config.mjs` - Usually auto-merges correctly
- `.github/workflows/**` - Deployment configurations
- `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js` - Build configurations

## Update Process Details

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before updating, ensure:
- All changes are committed: `git status`
- Your site builds successfully: `npm run build`
- (Optional) Test your site: `npm run dev`

### Step 2: Run Update Script

```bash
npm run update-core
```

The script will:
1. **Create backup** - Saves current state to a dated branch
2. **Fetch changes** - Downloads latest s:CMS updates
3. **Show preview** - Lists what will change
4. **Ask confirmation** - You decide whether to proceed
5. **Merge updates** - Integrates changes while protecting `usr/`
6. **Install dependencies** - Updates packages if needed

## Site-Specific Packages

Because `npm run update-scms` replaces `package.json` with the upstream (core) version, any packages you added manually to `package.json` would be wiped on every update.

The solution is `usr/scripts/local-packages.yml` — a YAML list of npm packages specific to your implementation. This file lives inside `usr/`, so it is **always preserved** across updates. The update script reads it and runs `npm install` for those packages automatically at the end of every update.

### Setup

Create or edit `usr/scripts/local-packages.yml`:

```yaml
# usr/scripts/local-packages.yml
- gsap
- d3
- @types/d3      # inline comments are supported
- swiper@11      # pin to a specific version
```

You can also install them manually at any time without running the full update:

```bash
# parse and install local packages directly
grep -E '^\s*-\s+[^#]' usr/scripts/local-packages.yml \
  | sed 's/^\s*-\s*//' | sed 's/\s*#.*//' \
  | xargs npm install
```

### How It Works

During `npm run update-scms` the script:
1. Replaces `package.json` with the upstream version and runs `npm install`
2. Reads `usr/scripts/local-packages.yml`
3. Runs `npm install <packages>` for every package listed there

If the file does not exist or contains no uncommented entries, this step is silently skipped.

### Step 3: Review and Test

After a successful update:

```bash
# Review what changed
git log HEAD~1..HEAD

# Test your site
npm run dev

# Check the production build
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Cleanup

If everything works:

```bash
# Delete the backup branch (replace with actual branch name from script output)
git branch -d backup-before-update-20260202-123456
```

If something went wrong:

```bash
# Restore from backup
git reset --hard backup-before-update-20260202-123456
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If the update script reports conflicts, don't panic! Here's how to resolve them:

### package.json Conflicts

**Strategy:** Keep your dependencies + add new framework dependencies

```bash
# 1. Open package.json
# 2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
# 3. Merge dependencies from both sections
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Save and run:
git add package.json
npm install
git commit
```

**Example:**
```json
<<<<<<< HEAD (your version)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^5.0.0",
    "my-custom-package": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
=======
{
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^5.1.0",
    "photoswipe": "^5.4.4"
  }
}
>>>>>>> upstream/scms

// Resolve to:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^5.1.0",           // Use newer version
    "my-custom-package": "^1.0.0", // Keep your addition
    "photoswipe": "^5.4.4"         // Add new framework dep
  }
}
```

### astro.config.mjs Conflicts

**Usually auto-merges** due to the coreConfig + userConfig pattern. If not:

1. Keep the merge structure
2. Ensure your `usr/user.config.mjs` imports are preserved
3. Verify the merge function is intact

### Other Config Files

Review changes and decide case-by-case:
- `.github/workflows/**` - Keep your deployment setup, review new features
- `tsconfig.json` - Usually safe to accept upstream version
- `tailwind.config.js` - Merge your customizations with new settings

## Release Notes & Migration Guides

Always check the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) after updating for:
- Breaking changes
- New features
- Manual migration steps
- Deprecated APIs

## Manual Update (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Create backup
git checkout -b backup-before-update

# 2. Fetch upstream
git fetch upstream main

# 3. Merge (protecting usr/)
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Resolve any conflicts
# ... edit files ...
git add .
git commit

# 5. Install dependencies
npm install

# 6. Test
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Upstream remote not configured"

Run: `npm run setup-upstream`

### "You have uncommitted changes"

Commit your work first:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save work before update"
```

### Update fails but you want to retry

Reset and try again:
```bash
git merge --abort
npm run update-core
```

### Completely undo an update

Restore from backup:
```bash
git reset --hard backup-before-update-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update regularly** - Smaller, frequent updates are easier than large jumps
2. **Read changelogs** - Know what's changing before you update
3. **Test locally first** - Always test after updating before deploying
4. **Keep backups** - The script creates them automatically
5. **Don't edit core/** - Make customizations in `usr/` only
