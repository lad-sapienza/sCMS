s:CMS is a project of [LAD: Laboratorio di Archeologia Digitale alla Sapienza](https://purl.org/lad) aimed at providing an easy to use management system for rich and multimedial contents, with a particular attention to the publication online of research data and geodata hosted in external databases.

It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites, completed with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The new version brings improved performance and a cleaner architecture.

## Main features

- **s:CMS is secure**: once the site is built, all you publish online are static web pages, plain HTML, JS and CSS. No programming languages, no databases, no security updates to apply, no security holes...
- **s:CMS is fast**: static sites deliver optimal performance with zero client-side JavaScript by default
- **s:CMS is serverless**: deploy anywhere - no server maintenance required
- **s:CMS is feature-rich**: extensible architecture allowing custom components and integrations
