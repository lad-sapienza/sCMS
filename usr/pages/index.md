# s:CMS

A modern static site Content Management System developed and maintained by LAD: Laboratorio di Archeologia Digitale alla Sapienza.

s:CMS is an open source, ready-to-use content management system for [generating static sites](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/). It provides data-oriented components for easily **connecting**, **displaying**, and **analyzing** research data stored in databases, flat files, or remote sources. Features include interactive maps, searchable tables, and (soon) charts.

Our goal is to enable researchers to publish rich data portals online, pulling information from a wide range of sources—static files, remote services, or online databases. We build components—reusing well-known open source projects—to make integration seamless and offer a simplified workflow for securely publishing content.

      <h4>Why static sites?</h4>
      <p className="text-muted mb-3">
        Static sites are fast, secure, and durable: no databases to manage, no code that gets outdated, no performance issues. Once you build and deploy your site, you can be confident it will keep working.
